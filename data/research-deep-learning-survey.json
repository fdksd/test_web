Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\n- Architecture design principles\n- Popular architectures (ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet)\n- Applications in image classification and object detection\n\n### 2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\n- LSTM and GRU variants\n- Applications in sequence modeling\n- Attention mechanisms\n\n### 3. Transformer Architecture\n- Self-attention mechanisms\n- Applications in NLP and vision\n- Recent developments and variants\n\n## Results\n\nWe analyze over 200 papers published in top-tier conferences and journals, providing insights into:\n\n- Performance comparisons across different architectures\n- Computational efficiency considerations\n- Real-world applications and limitations\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDeep learning continues to evolve rapidly, with new architectures and techniques emerging regularly. This survey provides a foundation for understanding current state-of-the-art approaches and identifying future research directions.\n\n## References\n\n1. LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., & Hinton, G. (2015).
